This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO).  The `BuggyKVO.m` file shows code that fails to remove a KVO observer in the `dealloc` method of a custom class. This leads to a crash when the observed object is deallocated. The `FixedKVO.m` file provides the corrected implementation, showing how to properly remove the observer to prevent the crash.  The bug typically manifests as an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  This example is crucial for understanding proper memory management in Objective-C when using KVO.
